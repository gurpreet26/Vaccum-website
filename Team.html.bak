					<p>Everywhere we turn in the business world, the power of digital disruptions has been providing a transformative edge to those who understand it. </p> 
                    <p>One would hence assume that the IT service pioneers with a knack for digital know how should be the leading transformers of their own environments. </p> 
                    <p>that’s not happening. Why? Because our enormously successful industry believes it has already perfected the ‘people & process’ models that are required for our business. </p>
                    <p>our winning formula stays unchanged: an outward focus on the evolving needs of our customer base. For instance, presently, we are busy capitalizing on the massive appetite for digital transformation technologies in the global markets. 
                    Unfortunately, our steadfast focus on ‘opportunities’ has blindfolded us to the ‘threats’ that this very digital transformation poses to our own relevance!</p>
